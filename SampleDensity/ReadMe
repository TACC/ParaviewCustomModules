This directory contains a "plugin" to sample volumetric datasets proportionally to 
a scalar variable.  The variable has to be *cell-centered*.  The dataset has to be
tetrahedral.

This filter will normalize the designated variable to [0,1] - all 1, if the data is
constant. For best results, transform the input so that the value if interest (which
might not be the max) is mapped to 1, and down to 0 as a function of your interest.
You can then raise the result to a power to further accentuate the desired value.

As an example: if you want to sample an "isosurface" at a value k:

left = k - min
right = max - k

pdf = 1 - abs(data - k)/max(left, right))

or something like that.

To build, go into the src directory and run:

python setup.py build

If all goes well, you will find a .so shared lib somewhere under the build subdir.
Copy that file to ~/python/_sample.so

Then, if you are using Paraview 5.6 load the SampleDensity.xml file as a plugin.  If
5.8, use SampleDensity.py.   Note that in 5.6 it will offer all variables to you; use 
only cell-centered ones.

There are demo PVSMs for use with 5.6 and 5.8
