# ParaviewCustomModules

## Overview

This repo contains a set of custom modules for use with ParaView[1].  These include:

**SampleSurface**: Given a PolyData surface (think Contour output) sample randomly and independently of triangle size.  I use it to seed streamlines in a contour just below sea level.  Remember this data is not flat; I contour the magnitude of the coordinates to get distance to the center of the world, which I contour at 0.999 to get a surface plane.

**JoinStreamlines**:  Join the forward and backward streamlines from each seed point into a single polyline.  

**SampleArcLength**: Sample a set of poly lines based on arc length.   I think I can use integration time also to get samples equally spaced in time rather than space.

**OrientedGlyph**: Takes two inputs: a set of samples with at least two direction vectors and a polydata glyph.  Places the glyph at each sample point in the coordinate space defined by the two given directional vectors and their cross product. Using SampleArcLength on JoinStreamlineâ€™d VTK streamlines produces tangent and normal.

**CurvatureStreamlines**: Calculates local curvature in polylines.  Creates a curvature map using a downsampled version of the input polylines to avoid noise in almost-straight or oversampled sections.    Dot the result with the local up vector to get the direction that eddies are spinning.

**TrimStreamlines**:  Trim a streamline to an interval of integration time, given by two properties.

To use these, run 'Make' in the download directory.   This will invoke Kitware's 	python_filter_generator.py to create .xml files for each.   These can then be added to Paraview using Tools->Manage Plugins.
